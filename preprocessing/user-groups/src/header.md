I wanted to know the relative sizes of the various Rust-specific Meetup groups so I collected them into a YAML file and then generated this page.
If you are interested which one is meeting in the next month or so check out [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/).
They send out an up-to-date list every week. If you are interested in virtual events I also maintain a page where you can find
[Vritual Rust events](https://events.code-maven.com/) that are better suited for your time-zone.

If you find a group near-by where you live or where you work, join them. If none of them are near-by, don't worry, there are quite a few that have
online meetings you can join from any place.

Another measurement could be frequency of events and the number of attendees at the events, but it that's much harder to collect so I stayed with
the number of members.

* On 2023.12.11 there were 99 groups with a total of 59,629 members.
* On 2024.03.17 there were 113 groups with a total of 65,200 members.
* On 2024.06.17 there were 116 groups with a total of 68,126 members.
* On 2024.12.17 there were 132 groups with a total of 77,688 members.

Total number of members: {} (the same person might be member of several groups.)
