If you have arrived to this page that's probably because you use Rust and you would like to ensure it is constantly improved. You might already know how to contribute
your time to Rust itself or to the thousands of [Rust Crates](https://crates.io/), but you might also want to help some of the Rust projects with money.

You might work at an organization that relies on Rust and the organization will want to support the development of the Rust ecosystem.

If your **product/company** depends on Rust, or if they think to start using Rust in the future they can financiall sponsor the Rust ecosystem.

You can sponsor the [Rust Foundation](https://rustfoundation.org/) directly or you can sponsor specific Rust projects or individual contributors to make it easier for them to focus on their open source work.

In order to sponsor projects and individual developers probably the easiest way is to do so via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/).

One way to find who to sponsor is to find the developers of your current dependencies. For that visit the [Explore GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/explore)
page. On the left-hand side select the "Cargo" ecosystem. That will show you the individuals and the organizations that you currenly rely upon that also accept sponsorship.

Alternativelly you could locate the individual developers or organizations yourself.


In order to make that easier, I started to create a list here. For some of them I even published an article. (Your suggestions adding more people and projects are welcome. The easiest way to do that might be to open an [issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/).)

Obviously, I'd be also happy if you [sponsored me](https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/)
