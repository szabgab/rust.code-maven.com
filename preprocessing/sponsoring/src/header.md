If you arrived to this page that's probably because you use Rust and you would like to ensure it is constantly improved. You might already know how to contribute
your time to Rust itself or to the thousands of [Rust Crates](https://crates.io/), but you might also want to help some of the Rust projects with money.

You might work at an organization that relies on Rust and the organization might want to support the development of the Rust ecosystem.

If your **product/company** depends on Rust, you can sponsor people here to ensure they keep happily maintaining them.


In [this series of articles](https://dev.to/szabgab/github-sponsors-a-series-on-giving-an-receiving-4fmb) I am reviewing how various Open Source developers employ
the [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/) system to get funding. Many of the articles are about Rust developers or Rust projects.

On this page you will find the list of them with links to their projects and to the articles where it already exists. If you would like to add someone who is not in the
list yet, please open an [issue](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/).

Obviously, I'd be also happy if you [sponsored me](https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/)
