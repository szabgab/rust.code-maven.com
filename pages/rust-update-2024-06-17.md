June 17 is a rather arbitrary date to write this first report, but the [Rust user groups](/user-groups) page was updated exactly 3 months ago. As I updated the numbers
there today I wanted to submit it to [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), but, rather understandably, they don't like to include the same URL twice.
They even have a CI job failing if the same URL is submitted twice.

So I figured instead of submitting that page I could update some of the other data pages I collected and I could write a report about the changes. That will be probably more
interesting and it will also have a different URL. Then if I remember to update it later, I could repeate and maybe expand this report.

So this is the report.

## [Rust User Groups](/user-groups)

There are mostly Meetup groups, though not all of them.
