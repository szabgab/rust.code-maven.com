This post will be ready soon... in time before This week in Rust is published


June 17 is a rather arbitrary date to write this report, but the [Rust user groups](/user-groups) page was updated exactly 3 months ago. As I updated the numbers
there today I wanted to submit it to [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), but, rather understandably, they don't like to include the same URL twice.
They even have a CI job failing if the same URL is submitted twice.

So I figured instead of submitting that page I could update some of the other data pages I collected and I could write a report about all the changes. That will be probably more
interesting and it will also have a different URL. Then if I remember to update it later, I could repeate and maybe expand this report a few months from now.

So this is the report.

## [Rust User Groups](/user-groups)

There are mostly Meetup groups, though not all of them.

| date       | no. groups | members | change |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| 2023.12.11 |  99        | 59,629  |        |
| 2024.03.17 | 113        | 65,200  |  5,571 |
| 2024.06.17 | 116        | 68,126  |  2,926 |

This is 4.4% growth in 3 month or roughly 20% annually.
