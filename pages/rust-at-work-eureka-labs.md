In this episode, we explore how Rust is powering infrastructure at Eureka Labs - a blockchain company operating in a low-latency, high-throughput environment.

Eureka Labs is pioneering next-generation block building on Ethereum. Their work focuses on advancing the logic of block construction to support more efficient execution and expand the functionality that can be packed into each blockâ€™s limited timeframe.

Eli and Igal will discuss how Rust has been instrumental in developing their high-performance block builder. Before founding Eureka, the team tackled large-scale engineering and algorithmic problems across industries.
