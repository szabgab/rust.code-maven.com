I am rather active in the local Rust community and people started to ask me where to find Rust Jobs.
As I am self-employed and mostly provide training courses and help in development processes,
I have not looked at job sites too much.

Now, in order to help the people asking me I looked around and found several Rust-specific and several generic places.

However, I wonder,  when you are looking for a new job as a Rust developer, where do you search? Any of these? What is our experience with them?
Something else? Some place more specific to your country? Please share your links and your suggestions!

## Rust Specific

* [RustJobs.com](https://www.rustjobs.com/)
* [RustJobs.dev](https://rustjobs.dev/)
* [Rust-Jobs.com](https://rust-jobs.com/)
* [Rust Jobs](https://rust.jobs/)
* [Rust Careers](https://rust.careers/)
* [Rust Career](https://rust.career/)
* [Rustjobs fyi](https://www.rustjobs.fyi/) It does not seem to be maintained any more. See [issue](https://github.com/NicholasLYang/rustjobs.fyi/issues/11)

## Generic
