I am rather active in the local Rust community and people started to ask me where to find Rust Jobs.
As I am self-employed and mostly provide training courses and help in development processes,
I have not looked at job sites too much.

Now, in order to help the people asking me I looked around and found several Rust-specific and several generic places.

However, I wonder,  when you are looking for a new job as a Rust developer, where do you search? Any of these? What is our experience with them?
Something else? Some place more specific to your country? Please share your links and your suggestions!

## Rust Specific

* [RustJobs.com](https://www.rustjobs.com/)
* [RustJobs.dev](https://rustjobs.dev/) they are also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rustjobs-dev/) and on [Twitter](https://x.com/rustjobs_dev).
* [Rust-Jobs.com](https://rust-jobs.com/)
* [Rust Jobs](https://rust.jobs/)
* [Rust Careers](https://rust.careers/)
* [Rust Career](https://rust.career/)
* [Rustjobs fyi](https://www.rustjobs.fyi/) It does not seem to be maintained any more. See [issue](https://github.com/NicholasLYang/rustjobs.fyi/issues/11)

## Generic

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
* [Xing](https://www.xing.com/) (mostly for the German market)
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/)
* [Indeed](https://indeed.com/)
* [Reddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/rust/?f=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9F%92%BC%20jobs%20megathread%22)

## Suggestions by others:

* [Alex Pitsikoulis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-pitsikoulis-797640186/): "[Otta](https://otta.com/) you can filter by technologies here, always had lots of rust jobs posted." (Gabor: I did not have the patience to go over all the questions and to register just to see job posts that are not relevant to me.)
* [Serhii Kupriienko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serhii-kupriienko/): "Easy, [Djinni](https://djinni.co/)" - (Gabor: I did not sign up as I am not interested in a job post.)
* [Mandar Vaze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandarvaze/): "I watch [Mainmatter](https://www.youtube.com/@mainmatter2180). They usually interview folks who use Rust in production. I just follow the interviewee's website. They usually have rust jobs.". - (Gabor: I have not watched any yet, but it sounds interesting to hear from companies that use Rust in production.)
