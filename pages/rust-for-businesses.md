In this article I'll try to collect the business reasons to start using the Rust programming language.


* Better end-user experience, lower churn rate

Rust helps developers eliminate a large set of problems which means the released software is has less bugs, the service has less down-time. All other things fixed this will make the user-experience better and will lower the churn-rate.

Rust runs much faster than some of the alternatives (e.g. Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl), it is even fatster than Java. This, again, will lead to better end-user experience.


* Lower TOC - Total Cost of Ownership

There are tons of research that show the cost of fixing bugs in software grows rapidly as time passes between creating the bug and fixing the bug. Specifically fixing a bug found in production can easily cost 100 times more than fixing it during development. Rust helps reducing this cost by enforcing strict rules that will eliminate a set of well known problems.


* Lower security risks

The cost associated with security issues is huge. Microsoft reports that the biggest source of security related bugs in their software is incorrect memory management. Rust practically eliminates most if not all such problems. That's one of the reasons Microsof is supporting the development of Rust and is adopting it in many areas.
