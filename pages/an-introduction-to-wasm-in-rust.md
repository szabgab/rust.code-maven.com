In this virtual event [Márk Tolmács](https://marktolmacs.com/), the author of [wasm2map](https://crates.io/users/mtolmacs) will introduce us to WASM using Rust.

This is part of the [Rust Maven live](/live) series.

WebAssembly (or WASM) is a very new concept brought to life by the ever-increasing need for performance and complexity management, with the additional promise of letting adopters re-use their existing solutions in system-level languages, like C and C++ (and Rust!). While the promises are mostly true, compiling and running WebAssembly requires some preparation and awareness of its limitations. In this short pair programming session, I walk you through the compilation of your first  WebAssembly program, run it in your browser, access the DOM,  interface with JavaScript, and finally run the code in nodejs via the use of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).

Mark is a veteran IT professional who created complex software solutions for over 20 years (most notably at Ustream and IBM). The wide range of product and technical expertise he accumulated led him to his current endeavor consulting on the hardest challenges software companies face. He first stumbled upon Rust 5 years ago. He took advantage of the power and elegance of this newcomer of a system-level language to deliver custom tooling in various projects with great success.
