## Call for Participation

I would like to invite you to be a guest on one of these live events. There are several "tracks" or ideas on how:
* Show me your crate! How to use it? (various use cases). Why did you write it? What is missing? How to contribute? Maybe go over the implementation as well.
* Teach me how to X in Rust? Where X can be anything. Eg. build a web api, a web site, a web scraper, a crypto currency, a cli, tui, gui app. Etc.
* If you gave a presentation at your local in-person event we could have the same presentation, or an extended version of it, on our live event.
* Talk to [Gabor](https://szabgab.com/contact) if you are interested.
