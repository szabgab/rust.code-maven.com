Welcome to the Rust Maven web site about, well, the Rust programming language!

The first article, published on Aug 27, 2023, is about printing [Hello World](/hello-world). You can find all the other articles in the [archive](/archive) or you can look at the [tags](/tags).
The site also includes the [slides](/slides/rust/) of my [Rust training courses](/training-course).

I hope you will enjoy the content and encourage me to improve the site and write more articles.

You might think that this site has some relation to the Java Maven, but I'll have to disappoint you. The word maven is just an (almost) ordinary word in English.
It actually came from Hebrew word meaning "understands" via Yiddish to American English and it basically means "someone who understands things and likes to explain them".

Or at least that's how I use it.

## Topics

There are a number of series of articles on the site in the following topics:

* [CLI - Clap](/clap) Command Line Argument Parser for Rust.
* [YAML](/yaml) - Dealing with YAML files in Rust.
* [JSON](/json) - Serializing and deserializing JSON in Rust.
