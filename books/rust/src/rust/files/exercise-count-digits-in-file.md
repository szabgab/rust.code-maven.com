# Exercise count digits in file


Write a function that receives a string as a parameter and returns an array of 10 numbers,
the number of each digit in the file. At first you can assume the file contains a single
row containing only digits: `234566`. Then make the input file more complex

* Having multiple rows and including digits and spaces.
* Having multiple rows and including any character.

In each case we only need to count the number of each digit.
