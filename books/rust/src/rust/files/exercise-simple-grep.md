# Exercise - simple grep

* Implement a simple version of grep that receives a search-term and a file and shows the lines in the file that match.

* Extend it to be able to work on more than one file.
* Extend it to accept regex as the search-term
* Extend it to accept an `-r` or `--recursive` flag and if given a folder then process each file recursively.
