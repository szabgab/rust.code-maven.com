# Print type of variable

* type_name
* type_name_of_val

* Sometimes during development, during the exploration of Rust it is useful to print the type of a varible.
* This is one way to do it.
* It will be added to the stanard library as [type_name_of_val](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/any/fn.type_name_of_val.html).
