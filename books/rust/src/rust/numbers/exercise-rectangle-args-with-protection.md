# Exercise: Rectangle ARGS with protection

* Change the previous solution to have a function that accepts 2 `u8` values and returns the area as `u8`.
* What should happen if the two numbers are both 20?
* One solution should return 255 in that case.
* You might provide other solutions as well, but for now this one is enough.
