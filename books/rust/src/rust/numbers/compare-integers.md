# Compare integers

* cmp
* Less
* Greater
* Equal
* Ordering

* We can use the regular `<`, `>`, `==` operators to compare any type of integers assuming the two sides are from the same type.
* The `cmp` method returns a value from the [Ordering](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html) enum.
