# Arrays in Rust

* [Array](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html)
* [The Array Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-array-type) in the book.
* An Array in Rust has a fixed number of elements.
* All the elements are of the same type.
* In mutable arrays we can change the content, but we still cannot add or remove elements.
