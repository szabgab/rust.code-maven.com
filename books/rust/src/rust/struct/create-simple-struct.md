# Create simple struct

* struct

* A simple `struct` will have one or more fields. Each field has a name and a type.
* We can then create an instance of the struct with actual values.
* We can use the dot-notation to access the values of the fields.
* We cannot change the values unless we declare the struct as mutable using the `mut` keyword.
