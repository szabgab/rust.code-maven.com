# Clap: improving the help with value_name

* value_name

By default the help (generated by providing `-h`) includes the name of the field in angle brackets.
This is usually a repetition of the parameter name in upper case letters.
In many cases this gives good indication of the value the program is expecting, but sometimes you might want to give a better hint.
In such cases you can set the string that will appear inside the angle brackets using the `value_name` parameter.

* In this example the input field has the default: `INPUT` while the out field was set to `FILENAME` by the `value_field.`
