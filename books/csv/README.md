## TODO

* What if a field is missing (basically there is an empty string instead of the value) How can we set a default value for that? Especially numerical columns.
* What if a field has "na" in it meaning not available? Especially numerical columns.
* How can we skip a row (e.g. if one of the fields is missing)?
