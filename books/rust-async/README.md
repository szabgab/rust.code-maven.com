## TODO

* See the http section for examples.

* show an example of a computationally heavy task that I run in async (severeal in parallel) and how they hand back execution to the eventloop.


* Download many urls example: read the file line by line and call the download_page function for each URL
* use streams (iterators)
* futures::streams::stream

* crawler: backpressure, rate-limiting, throttling
