# Drawbacks

* The ecosystem is less mature than for other languages.
* Not enough developers.
* Some aspects of the language still lag behind other languages (eg. Async in Go is easier).
* For embedded systems - not all hardware are supported. Yet. [Platform support](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html)
* Compile time.
