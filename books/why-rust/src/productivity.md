# Productivity

* Productivity - [on par with Go, 2x as C++ at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrrH2lcl9ew)
* Spend less time writing tests.
* Spend less time debugging.
* Safer to use AI generated code (because the compiler will catch a lot of issues).
* Easy to write and distribute(!) cross-platform code for Windows, Linux, macOS. Especially small command-line tools.
* Fearless concurrency.
