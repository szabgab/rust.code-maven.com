# Exercise: enum for programming languages

* Create an enum representing "all" the programming languages. (py for Python, rs for Rust)
* Add a constructor to return the enum based on the file extension.
* Remember, Perl uses both `pl` and `pm` as extensions.
* Write tests that will check some of the cases.
