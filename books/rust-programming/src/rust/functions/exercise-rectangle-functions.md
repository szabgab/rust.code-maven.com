# Exercise rectangle functions


In an earlier chapter we had an exercise to ask the use for the length and the width of a rectangle and print the
area and the circumference to the screen.

Simplify it by moving the code that reads the number from STDIN into a function that we call twice. Once for the width and one for the length.
