# Convert string to (integer) number - parse, turbofish

* i32
* parse
* expect
* ::<>()

* In the printing we won't see the difference, but we can do numberical operations on numbers.
* We can either define the expect type next to the variable name where we are assigning to.
* Or we can use the so-called **turbofish** operator `::<>()` as we do in the second example.
