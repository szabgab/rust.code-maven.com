# Rust tuple - fixed-sizes, mixed, ordered collection

* tuple
* parenthesis
* ()

* Each value can be any type. (heterogeneous)
* The types and the number of elements are fixed at creation.
* In this example the types are deducted from the values.
* It is ordered.
* We can access the individual elements using their index and the dot-notation.

* The content can be changed only if the definition uses `mut`.
