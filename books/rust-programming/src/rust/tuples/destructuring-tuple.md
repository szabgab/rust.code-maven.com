# Destructuring tuple

* _
* underscore

* It is not **destructing**! Just looks similar.
* It means taking the values of a tuple apart into individual variables.
* We have to assign all the values.
* We can use the underscore `_` (multiple times) as a placeholder for the value we don't want to assign.

* Alternatively, we could assign them one-by-one.
