# Exercise: concatenate file content

* TODO

Write a function that received the name of two files and returns the content of the two files concatenated in both directions.

e.g. If file 1 contains "cat" and file 2 contains "dog" then return "catdog" and "dogcat"

{% embed include file="src/examples/ownership/concatenate-content-of-files/src/main.rs" %}

* TODO: This works, but let's also implement without format!
* TODO: Return Result
