# Exercise: Count words using two vectors

* Given a string that consists of words and white-spaces, count how many times each word appears!
* In this solution we use two vectors. A much better solution would be to use `HashMap`, but in this example I wanted to show the solution with two vectors.
* One vector will hold the list of distinct words.
* The second vector will hold the count for each word.
