# Interpolation

Since Rust 1.58, so for quite a ling time, we can also include the name of a variable in the curly braces. This feature is called interpolation.
It usually make the expression more readable.

{% embed include file="src/examples/intro/interpolation/src/main.rs" %}

The output:

{% embed include file="src/examples/intro/interpolation/out.out" %}
