# Editor and IDE

You can use any editor or IDE to write Rust code, but there are a few that stand out.

I personally use VS Code with the approprite plugins and vim without anything.

Let me know your favorite setup!

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the `rust-analyzer` plugin. [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is an implementation of [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for the Rust.
* [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) (From JetBrains, creator of PyCharm, IntelliJ).
* vim or neovim + rust-analyzer
