# Rust - reverse string

* chars
* rev
* collect

This is a simple, and apparently partially incorrect solution. There is a crate called [unicode_reverse](https://crates.io/crates/unicode_reverse) for doing it right.

{% embed include file="src/examples/strings/reverse/src/main.rs" %}
{% embed include file="src/examples/strings/reverse/out.out" %}
