# What is a template engine?


* We would like to create several texts (e.g. web pages, content of email, some report) that look exactly the same but will have different data.
* We design the page, but instead of values we use vairables (or placeholders, if you prefer that word) that look like this: `{{ ttitle }}`.
* The template engine then can replace those placeholder variables by the appropriate value.

* Besides replacing individual values, a template system usually has more complex syntax as well. Loops, conditionals, includes etc.
