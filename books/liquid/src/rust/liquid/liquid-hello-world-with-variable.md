# Liquid Hello World with variable

* Using the same template as earlier we see how we can reuse the template in 3 different ways:

* The value of "name" is hard-coded in the call to `object!`
* The value of "name" is hard-coded in a variable as `str`.
* The value of "name" is a `String` that could come from the outside world (e.g. from a file).
