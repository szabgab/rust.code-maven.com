Hi,


## Articles

I've published quite a few articles since my last message. You can find them in the [archive](https://rust.code-maven.com/archive)

## Workshops

As you know I love explaining things, but I think the best way to learn something is to create something and get feedback for it.
So I am planning to run a few virtual workshops where I explain the basics of some technology, the participants then implement
something using that technology while I provide feedback.

The first such workshop will be on June 6, 2024 with the title: **Your first contribution to an Open Source Rust project**.

If you are interested [register here](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301156302/).

I plan to run these workshops free of charge and hope that the participants will recognize the value
and will want to "pat it forward" so to speak, and start [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/)
so I can run many more such workshops. If you already found value in my articles, I'd appreciate if you set up a $5 or $10 per month sponsorship.
That will also encourage others to setup their sponsorship.



Enjoy!
