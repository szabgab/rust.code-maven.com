Hi,

## Workshops

As I mentioned last week I've started to organize online workshops.

Since then I scheduled a few more. You are invited to join either one or all of them:

* 2024.06.06 [Your first contribution to an Open Source Rust project](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301156302/).
* 2024.06.09 [GitHub pages for Rust developers](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301215326/).
* 2024.06.16 [Web development in Rust using Rocket](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301294669/).


I plan to run more so I prepared a short survey to better understand the topics you might be interested in,
and the day and time that could be good for you. I'd appreciate if you filled out this
